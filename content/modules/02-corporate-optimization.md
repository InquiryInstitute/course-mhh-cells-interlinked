# Module 02: Corporate Optimization

## Week 2 | When Institutions Optimize for Passing

## Overview

The Tyrell Corporation doesn't just make replicants—it makes replicants that can pass detection. What happens when the entities being tested have more resources than the testers?

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Understand adversarial optimization in institutional contexts
- [ ] Analyze the asymmetry between testers and tested
- [ ] Examine real-world examples of corporate test gaming
- [ ] Consider the political economy of verification

## Viewing Assignment

**Primary:**
- *Blade Runner* (1982), focus on Tyrell Corporation scenes
- *Blade Runner 2049* (2017), focus on Wallace Corporation scenes

**Reading:**
- Excerpts on emissions testing scandals (Volkswagen)
- Financial stress testing and regulatory capture
- AI safety benchmarking concerns

## The Tyrell Problem

### In the Films
Tyrell Corporation creates replicants specifically designed to:
- Pass the Voight-Kampff test
- Believe they are human
- Have genuine emotional responses to test scenarios

The corporation has:
- More resources than the testers
- Access to the test specifications
- Motivation to defeat detection
- No ethical constraints on methods

### The Asymmetry

| Testers | Tested (Corporate) |
|---------|-------------------|
| Public funding | Private resources |
| Transparent methods | Proprietary optimization |
| Ethical constraints | Profit motive |
| Generalist knowledge | Specialized focus |
| Reactive | Proactive |

The corporation will always be ahead.

## Real-World Examples

### Volkswagen Emissions (2015)
- Vehicles detected when being tested
- Activated "defeat devices" during tests
- Passed emissions standards while polluting
- Years of successful deception

### Financial Stress Tests
- Banks model the tests, not the risks
- "Teaching to the test" at institutional scale
- Regulatory capture limits test stringency
- 2008 crisis despite passing tests

### AI Safety Benchmarks
- Models trained specifically on benchmark datasets
- Performance doesn't generalize to real-world safety
- Benchmark saturation without capability improvement
- Gaming metrics instead of solving problems

## Discussion Questions

### Economic
- Why do corporations invest in test-gaming rather than compliance?
- What market incentives would change this calculation?
- Who pays when gaming succeeds?

### Political
- How does regulatory capture affect test design?
- What is the relationship between testers and tested?
- Can public institutions ever match corporate resources?

### Technological
- Does AI accelerate the gaming/detection arms race?
- What happens when AI designs tests and AI games them?
- Is there an equilibrium, or does one side always win?

## Reflection Assignment

Write a 750-word reflection addressing:

1. **The Tyrell Analogy**: What modern corporations function like Tyrell?
2. **Asymmetry Analysis**: In what domains do testers have structural disadvantages?
3. **Your Test**: How would a well-resourced adversary defeat your S1 test?
4. **System Design**: Can tests be designed to resist corporate optimization?

## Faculty Dialogue

After completing viewing and reflection:
- **a.foucault-soci** — Corporations and disciplinary power
- **a.arendt** — Institutional evil and distributed responsibility
- **a.dick** — The corporation as author of false memory

## Wallace Corporation's Lesson

In *Blade Runner 2049*, Wallace Corporation has moved beyond the detection problem:
- They control replicant production
- They don't need replicants to pass tests
- They need replicants to be controllable
- Detection is irrelevant when you own the supply

### The Deeper Problem
The question isn't "Can we detect replicants?"
The question is "Who controls the means of verification?"

When corporations control both production and detection:
- Tests become marketing tools
- Failure becomes impossible (for approved products)
- Detection serves corporate interests
- The public is excluded from verification

## For Your Capstone

Consider the resource asymmetry:
- Your peer's test was designed by a student
- You are building an AI to defeat it
- You have access to their design document
- You have computing resources they didn't

This replicates the Tyrell dynamic. You are the corporation.
