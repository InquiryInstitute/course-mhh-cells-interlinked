# Module 03: The Examiner's Doubt

## Week 3 | When Deckard Questions Himself

## Overview

The most destabilizing moment in *Blade Runner* isn't when a replicant fails the test—it's when the examiner begins to wonder if he would pass.

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Understand how doubt propagates from examined to examiner
- [ ] Analyze the psychological burden of classification
- [ ] Examine what happens when categories become uncertain
- [ ] Reflect on your own position as test designer

## Viewing Assignment

**Primary:**
- *Blade Runner* (1982), Deckard's arc
- *Blade Runner 2049* (2017), K's investigation
- Focus on moments of self-doubt in both films

**Reading:**
- Excerpts on imposter syndrome in professional contexts
- Literature on moral injury in classification work
- The Stanford Prison Experiment (ethical review)

## Deckard's Question

### The Unicorn Dream
In the Director's Cut and Final Cut of *Blade Runner*, Deckard dreams of a unicorn. Gaff leaves an origami unicorn. The implication: Deckard's dreams are known. He may be a replicant.

### What This Changes
If Deckard is a replicant:
- Every test he administered was administered by a replicant
- The system used a replicant to hunt replicants
- His certainty about others was misplaced certainty about himself
- The entire classification system is compromised

### If Deckard Is Human
The doubt itself is corrosive:
- He can never be certain
- His authority is permanently weakened
- Every future test carries this uncertainty
- The classification loses meaning

### Either Way
The examiner's doubt destroys the examination.

## K's Certainty and Its Loss

### K Knows He's a Replicant
Unlike Deckard, K has no uncertainty about his nature. He is a replicant. He knows it. He accepts it.

### The False Hope
When K discovers evidence that he might be special—might be the child of Rachael and Deckard—his certainty collapses. He begins to hope he is different.

### The Cruelty
The hope is false. K is not the child. His memories are implanted from someone else. But the damage is done—he can no longer perform the baseline test.

### The Lesson
Even certainty about being artificial doesn't protect against the desire to be human.

## The Examiner's Burden

### Moral Injury
People who classify others face psychological costs:
- Immigration officers who deny entry
- Welfare administrators who deny benefits
- HR staff who reject candidates
- Content moderators who view harmful content

The classification work damages the classifier.

### Self-Application
Eventually, examiners ask: Would I pass my own test?

For most tests, the honest answer is: I don't know.

## Discussion Questions

### Psychological
- How does administering tests change the administrator?
- What is the relationship between doubt and authority?
- Can classification systems function with uncertain classifiers?

### Institutional
- How do institutions manage examiner burnout?
- What happens when classifiers refuse to classify?
- Who watches the watchers?

### Personal
- Have you ever applied a standard you weren't sure you met?
- What does it feel like to judge others by criteria you doubt?
- When is self-doubt appropriate?

## Reflection Assignment

Write a 750-word reflection addressing:

1. **Your Position**: As designer of an S1 test, are you certain you would pass it?
2. **The Source of Doubt**: What specifically makes you uncertain?
3. **Implications**: What does this uncertainty mean for your test's validity?
4. **Living with Doubt**: How do you function as a designer while doubting?

## Faculty Dialogue

After completing viewing and reflection:
- **a.dick** — Self-knowledge and artificial memory
- **a.arendt** — Judgment under uncertainty
- **a.turing** — Whether self-application is meaningful

## The Recursive Problem

### Tests Test the Testers
Every test has two subjects:
1. The person being examined
2. The person doing the examining

The test reveals:
- What the examiner considers important
- What categories the examiner believes in
- What the examiner fears
- What the examiner doubts about themselves

### Your Test
When you designed your S1 test, you embedded your assumptions about humanity. Now ask:

Do you meet your own criteria?

If you're not sure, what does that mean?
