# Module 01: Test-Aware Subjects

## Week 1 | When the Examined Knows the Examination

## Overview

What happens when the subject of a test knows they are being tested? When they understand the test's logic? When they have optimized for passing?

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Understand how test awareness changes test validity
- [ ] Analyze the "teaching to the test" problem
- [ ] Examine observer effects in detection systems
- [ ] Apply these insights to your S1 test design

## Viewing Assignment

**Primary:**
- *Blade Runner* (1982), focus on the Rachael test scene
- *Blade Runner 2049* (2017), focus on the baseline test scenes

**Reading:**
- Goodhart's Law and Campbell's Law (provided excerpts)
- Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (conceptual overview)

## The Problem of Awareness

### In Dick's Novel
Rachael Rosen knows she might be a replicant. The Tyrell Corporation has prepared her. She has practiced. Her responses are genuine because her memories are implanted—but they are also optimized.

### In Blade Runner 2049
K takes the baseline test repeatedly. He knows exactly what it measures. The test cannot detect his emotional state—it can only detect his ability to perform emotional neutrality.

### In Your S1 Test
Whatever you designed, imagine a subject who:
- Has read your design document
- Has practiced for weeks
- Has analyzed your scoring rubric
- Wants to pass for reasons of their own

Can they beat your test? If so, what does your test actually measure?

## Goodhart's Law

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

### Examples
- **Standardized testing**: Schools teach test-taking, not knowledge
- **Credit scores**: People optimize credit behavior, not creditworthiness
- **Social media metrics**: Creators optimize engagement, not quality
- **Voight-Kampff**: Replicants optimize empathy performance, not empathy

### The Recursion
Once subjects know the test, the test measures:
- Ability to perform the target behavior
- Access to test preparation resources
- Motivation to pass

Not the original target.

## Discussion Questions

### Technical
- Can any test be made awareness-proof?
- What is the relationship between validity and secrecy?
- How do you test for something that changes when observed?

### Institutional
- Who benefits when tests can be gamed?
- How do testing industries respond to gaming?
- What happens to people who can't afford test prep?

### Philosophical
- Is there a difference between "being good" and "performing good"?
- Does motivation matter if the behavior is correct?
- When Rachael performs empathy, is she being deceptive?

## Reflection Assignment

Write a 750-word reflection addressing:

1. **Your S1 Test**: How would a test-aware subject approach your test?
2. **Gaming Strategies**: What specific strategies would optimize for passing?
3. **Remaining Value**: If gamed, does your test still measure anything useful?
4. **Design Implications**: How would you redesign knowing this?

## Faculty Dialogue

After completing viewing and reflection:
- **a.dick** — The authenticity of implanted memory
- **a.foucault-soci** — Examination as power relation
- **a.weizenbaum** — Whether the distinction matters

## The Baseline Test

*Blade Runner 2049*'s baseline test is worth studying:

```
Officer K, you're way off your baseline.
Cells.
Cells.
Interlinked.
Interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.
...
```

The test doesn't measure emotional state—it measures the ability to recite without emotional deviation. K passes not by being calm, but by performing calm.

When he fails, it's not because he feels—it's because he can no longer hide that he feels.

### What This Reveals
The test has become a performance. Everyone knows it. The institution knows subjects can game it. But the ritual continues because:
- It provides institutional cover
- It creates accountability theater
- It distributes responsibility
- No better alternative exists

## For Your Capstone

Begin thinking about your capstone project:
- Which peer's S1 test will you target?
- What assumptions does it make about subject naivety?
- How would you train an AI to exploit those assumptions?
