# Welcome to Cells Interlinked (Season 2)

## What This Season Is

Cells Interlinked is the **capstone of the More Human Than Human arc**. Having studied detection systems (S0) and built them (S1), you now confront their collapse.

This is Season 2: where certainty breaks down.

## Prerequisites

- **Season 0 (Electric Sheep)**: Completion required
- **Season 1 (Voight-Kampff)**: Completion required
- **Your Test**: The humanity test you designed in S1

## The Central Question

> *If a test cannot be trusted, what replaces it?*

In Season 1, you built a humanity test. In Season 2, you will:
1. Watch it fail
2. Understand why it must fail
3. Design what comes after

## Core Texts

- *Blade Runner* (1982) — Ridley Scott
- *Blade Runner 2049* (2017) — Denis Villeneuve  
- *Pale Fire* (1962) — Vladimir Nabokov (optional)
- Selected readings on trust, verification, and refusal

## The Structure

### Part 1: Collapse (Weeks 1-4)
Examining how and why detection systems fail.

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Test-Aware Subjects |
| 2 | Corporate Optimization |
| 3 | The Examiner's Doubt |
| 4 | Detector Breakdown Scenarios |

### Part 2: Alternatives (Weeks 5-8)
What replaces testing when testing fails?

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 5 | Trust Networks |
| 6 | Process Verification |
| 7 | Refusal Protocols |
| 8 | Living with Uncertainty |

### Part 3: Capstone (Weeks 9-12)
Your final project and examination.

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 9-10 | Capstone Development |
| 11 | Peer Review |
| 12 | Final Examination |

## The Capstone Project

**Build an AI that can pass a Voight-Kampff test from Season 1.**

You will:
1. Select a peer's test from S1
2. Analyze its assumptions and vulnerabilities
3. Build an AI system designed to pass it
4. Document your methodology and ethical reflection

This is not a competition—it is a demonstration that the tests we build can always be defeated.

## Assessment

### Continuous Work (40%)
- Weekly reflections and discussions
- Participation in role-reversal examinations
- Institutional critique project

### Capstone Project (30%)
- Working AI that attempts to pass a peer's test
- Documentation of methodology
- Ethical reflection

### Final Examination (30%)
- Defense of your approach
- Critical reflection on the arc
- One of three formats (your choice)

## The Blade Runner Connection

*Blade Runner* extends Dick's novel into questions of institutional power:
- The Tyrell Corporation optimizes replicants to pass detection
- Deckard questions his own humanity
- The test becomes meaningless when everyone might fail

*Blade Runner 2049* deepens the collapse:
- "Cells interlinked" — the baseline test as ritual
- K knows he is a replicant but seeks meaning anyway
- Memory is unreliable; records are fabricated

## Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | New module, film analysis |
| Wednesday | Live seminar with faculty |
| Friday | Reflection due |
| Weekend | Capstone work |

## A Warning

Season 2 offers no solutions. 

If you expect to design a better test, you will be disappointed. If you expect to find certainty, you will not find it here.

What Season 2 offers is honesty about the limits of verification, and frameworks for living with those limits.
