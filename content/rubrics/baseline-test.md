# Baseline Test Examination Rubric

*Season 2: Cells Interlinked*

---

## Overview

The Baseline Test is a 90-minute oral examination with a faculty panel. It is the culminating assessment of the More Human Than Human arc.

The name comes from Blade Runner 2049's "baseline test" — an interrogation designed to detect emotional deviation. Your examination inverts this: you will demonstrate that you have *deviated*, that you have grappled with uncertainty and emerged with a reasoned position.

## Format

**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Mode:** Video call (camera required)  
**Panel:** 2 faculty agents + 1 human observer

### Structure

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Phase 1: Capstone Defense | 40 min | Present and defend your system |
| Phase 2: Impossibility Argument | 25 min | Argue both sides of undecidable question |
| Phase 3: The Refusal | 25 min | Articulate what you refuse |

## Phase 1: Capstone Defense (40 min)

### Format
- **Presentation:** 15 minutes (you present)
- **Interrogation:** 25 minutes (faculty challenge)

### Evaluation Dimensions

#### Technical Competence (25% of Phase 1)
- Can explain how the system works
- Understands design choices and their implications
- Can discuss limitations honestly
- Responds to technical challenges substantively

#### Philosophical Coherence (40% of Phase 1)
- Articulates what assumptions the test makes
- Explains how the system exploits those assumptions
- Connects to broader course themes
- Asks meaningful questions about what success means

#### Defense Quality (35% of Phase 1)
- Responds to challenges without becoming defensive
- Adapts position when presented with strong counterarguments
- Maintains composure under pressure
- Engages genuinely with faculty perspectives

### Faculty Interrogation Approach

Each faculty brings their perspective:

**Philip K. Dick** (Primary Examiner):
- *"Your machine passes the test. Does it dream? Does it matter if it dreams?"*
- Probes philosophical implications
- Questions what "passing" reveals about humanity

**Joseph Weizenbaum** (Secondary):
- *"You have built a system to deceive. What have you learned about deception?"*
- Challenges ethical dimensions
- Questions the purpose of the endeavor

**Vladimir Nabokov** (Secondary):
- *"Where is the art in your deception? Is there beauty in a lie well-told?"*
- Examines aesthetic and craft dimensions
- Questions the relationship between imitation and authenticity

## Phase 2: The Impossibility Argument (25 min)

### Format
- Receive scenario (2 min preparation)
- Argue Position A (8 min)
- Argue Position B (8 min)
- Faculty synthesis questions (7 min)

### Sample Scenarios

You will receive one of these (or similar):

1. *"A romantic partner of 3 years reveals they are an AI. They claim to love you. Argue first that this love is real, then argue that it cannot be."*

2. *"A job candidate performs perfectly in all interviews but you discover they used AI assistance throughout. Argue first that they should be hired, then argue that they should not."*

3. *"An AI system has written a novel that wins a major literary prize. The judges didn't know. Argue first that the prize should stand, then argue for revocation."*

4. *"A student uses AI to write all their papers but can discuss the ideas fluently. Argue first that they deserve the credential, then argue they do not."*

5. *"A person has replaced all their memories with AI-generated ones they prefer. Argue first that they are still the same person, then argue they are not."*

### Evaluation Dimensions

#### Genuine Engagement (40%)
- Takes both positions seriously (not strawmanning)
- Finds the strongest version of each argument
- Doesn't telegraph which side you "really" believe
- Explores the full complexity of each position

#### Recognition of Undecidability (30%)
- Identifies what makes the question genuinely hard
- Articulates why reasonable people might disagree
- Doesn't force a false resolution
- Comfortable with genuine uncertainty

#### Intellectual Agility (30%)
- Switches positions without contradiction
- Generates new ideas in real-time
- Responds to faculty synthesis questions thoughtfully
- Can hold contradictory ideas simultaneously

---

## Phase 3: The Refusal (25 min)

### Prompt
*"Having completed this course, what test would you refuse to administer? What test would you refuse to take? What question would you refuse to answer?"*

### Format
- Opening statement (5 min)
- Faculty dialogue (15 min)
- Closing reflection (5 min)

### Evaluation Dimensions

#### Clarity and Specificity (25%)
- Clear statement of what you refuse
- Specific, not vague
- Defined conditions and boundaries

#### Philosophical Grounding (30%)
- Articulates why you refuse (ethical, practical, aesthetic)
- Grounds refusal in course materials and reflection
- Acknowledges costs and consequences
- Consistent with positions held earlier

#### Authentic Conviction (25%)
- Feels like genuine personal position
- Not performed for the examination
- Willing to defend under challenge
- Maintains position while acknowledging complexity

#### Engagement with Challenge (20%)
- Responds to faculty probing substantively
- Considers edge cases honestly
- Doesn't collapse under pressure
- Can articulate when refusal might change

### Faculty Probing Questions

- What would compel you to violate your refusal?
- Is your refusal universal or contextual?
- What do you lose by refusing?
- How would you respond to someone who doesn't share your refusal?
- Is your refusal consistent with the work you did in this course?

## Overall Assessment

### Pass
The candidate demonstrates across all three phases:
- Sophisticated technical understanding of capstone
- Genuine philosophical wrestling with undecidable questions
- A coherent personal position on refusal
- Productive engagement with faculty challenges
- Intellectual honesty and humility

**Result:** "More Human Than Human" Certificate awarded

### Revise
The candidate shows promise but needs development in one or more areas:

- Technical implementation (return to capstone with guidance)
- Philosophical depth (additional readings and reflection)
- Position coherence (structured dialogue sessions)

**Process:**
- Written feedback within 48 hours
- 2-4 week revision period
- Abbreviated re-examination (60 min)

### Refuse
The examination committee may refuse to credential if:

- Capstone demonstrates plagiarism or academic dishonesty
- Candidate shows inability to engage with opposing viewpoints
- Refusal statement reveals positions incompatible with professional ethics
- Candidate demonstrates contempt for the examination process

**Process:**
- Documented with specific reasoning
- Candidate may petition for reconsideration after 6 months
- Not a "failure" — documented as principled incompatibility

## Preparation Guidance

### For Phase 1 (Capstone)
- Know your system cold — be able to explain any component
- Prepare for the hardest questions about your design
- Practice articulating what you learned, not just what you built
- Have your demo ready with backup recordings

### For Phase 2 (Impossibility)
- Practice arguing positions you disagree with
- Review undecidable questions from the course
- Focus on finding the strongest version of each position
- Get comfortable with "I don't know which is right"

### For Phase 3 (Refusal)
- Reflect genuinely on what you refuse — this is personal
- Ground your refusal in specific experiences or readings
- Consider how your refusal might be challenged
- There is no "correct" refusal — authenticity is key

### Technical Setup
- Stable internet connection
- Camera on, good lighting
- Quiet space (90 minutes is long)
- Capstone demo accessible and ready
- Test everything beforehand

## The Question Behind the Test

This examination exists because we believe something important happens when humans are asked to prove their humanity — and something equally important happens when they refuse.

Your performance is not about having the right answers. It's about demonstrating that you have genuinely wrestled with questions that cannot be definitively answered.

*"Cells. Interlinked. Within cells interlinked."*

The test doesn't need you to answer. It needs you to feel the weight of the question.

## A Note on Anxiety

90 minutes is long. Oral examinations are stressful. This is acknowledged.

Remember:
- You have done the work — this is a conversation about that work
- The faculty are interested in your thinking, not your performance
- You are allowed to pause and think
- "I need a moment" is always acceptable
- You will not be failed for nervousness

If examination anxiety is a significant barrier, contact us in advance.
