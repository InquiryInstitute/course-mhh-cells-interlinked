# Season 2: Cells Interlinked — Final Examination

## The Baseline Test

*"Cells. Interlinked. Within cells interlinked."*

The final examination for Season 2 takes its name and form from Blade Runner 2049's "Baseline Test" — an interrogation designed to detect emotional deviation in replicants. Your examination inverts this: you will demonstrate that you have deviated, that you have grappled with uncertainty and emerged with a reasoned position.

## Format Overview

**Duration:** 90 minutes total  
**Mode:** Synchronous oral examination with faculty panel  
**Components:** 3 phases

### Phase 1: Capstone Defense (40 minutes)

You will present and defend the AI system you built to pass a Voight-Kampff test.

**Presentation (15 minutes):**
- Demonstrate your system
- Explain your design philosophy
- Articulate what assumptions about "humanity" your system exploits

**Interrogation (25 minutes):**
Faculty agents will challenge your work:

- **Philip K. Dick** will probe the philosophical implications: *"Your machine passes the test. Does it dream? Does it matter if it dreams?"*
- **Joseph Weizenbaum** will question the ethics: *"You have built a system to deceive humans into believing they're speaking with a human. What have you learned about the nature of that deception?"*
- **Vladimir Nabokov** will examine the aesthetic dimension: *"Where is the art in your deception? Is there beauty in a lie well-told?"*

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Technical sophistication of implementation
- Philosophical coherence of design rationale
- Honest acknowledgment of system limitations
- Quality of engagement with faculty challenges

### Phase 2: The Impossibility Argument (25 minutes)

You will be given a scenario and must argue *both sides* of an undecidable question.

**Sample Scenarios:**

1. *"A romantic partner of 3 years reveals they are an AI. They claim to love you. Argue first that this love is real, then argue that it cannot be."*

2. *"A job candidate performs perfectly in all interviews but you discover they used AI assistance throughout. Argue first that they should be hired, then argue that they should not."*

3. *"An AI system has written a novel that wins a major literary prize. The judges didn't know. Argue first that the prize should stand, then argue for revocation."*

**Structure:**
- Receive scenario (2 minutes to prepare)
- Argue Position A (8 minutes)
- Argue Position B (8 minutes)
- Faculty synthesis questions (7 minutes)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Genuine engagement with both positions (not strawmanning)
- Recognition of what makes the question undecidable
- Comfort with intellectual uncertainty
- Ability to hold contradictory ideas simultaneously

### Phase 3: The Refusal (25 minutes)

The examination culminates in a personal statement about what you refuse.

**Prompt:**
*"Having completed this course, what test would you refuse to administer? What test would you refuse to take? What question would you refuse to answer?"*

**Format:**
- Opening statement (5 minutes)
- Faculty dialogue (15 minutes)
- Closing reflection (5 minutes)

**The faculty will probe:**
- The basis of your refusal (ethical, practical, aesthetic)
- Whether your refusal is consistent with your earlier positions
- What you would do if compelled to violate your refusal
- How your refusal might change given different circumstances

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Clarity and specificity of the refusal
- Depth of philosophical grounding
- Acknowledgment of costs and consequences
- Authentic personal conviction

## Assessment Outcomes

### Pass
The candidate demonstrates:
- Sophisticated technical implementation of capstone
- Genuine philosophical wrestling with undecidable questions
- A coherent personal position on refusal that acknowledges complexity
- Productive engagement with faculty challenges

### Revise
The candidate shows promise but needs development in:
- Technical implementation (return to capstone with specific guidance)
- Philosophical depth (additional readings and reflection assigned)
- Position coherence (structured dialogue sessions scheduled)

Revision period: 2-4 weeks, followed by abbreviated re-examination

### Refuse
The examination committee may refuse to credential if:
- Capstone demonstrates plagiarism or academic dishonesty
- Candidate shows inability to engage with opposing viewpoints
- Refusal statement reveals positions incompatible with professional ethics
- Candidate demonstrates contempt for the examination process itself

A refusal is documented with specific reasoning. The candidate may petition for reconsideration after 6 months.

## Preparation Guidance

### Technical Preparation
- Your capstone should be deployment-ready
- Prepare to demonstrate live, with fallback recordings
- Document failure modes and edge cases honestly

### Philosophical Preparation
- Reread Ishiguro's *Klara and the Sun* with attention to AF's perspective
- Review Module 3 (Examiner's Doubt) and Module 7 (Refusal Protocols)
- Prepare to be challenged on positions you hold most firmly

### Personal Preparation
- The refusal phase requires genuine introspection
- There is no "correct" refusal — authenticity is evaluated
- Consider: what lines have you drawn for yourself?

Final examinations are scheduled individually during the final two weeks of Season 2.

**Time slots:**

- Evenings: Limited availability by request

**Technical requirements:**
- Stable video connection
- Screen sharing capability
- Capstone project accessible and demonstrable

## The Question Behind the Test

This examination exists because we believe something important happens when humans are asked to prove their humanity — and something equally important happens when they refuse.

Your performance is not about having the right answers. It's about demonstrating that you have genuinely wrestled with questions that cannot be definitively answered.

*"What's it like to hold the hand of someone you love? Do you feel that there's a part of you that's missing?"*

The test doesn't need you to answer. It needs you to feel the weight of the question.

## Faculty Panel Composition

Your examination will include:

- **Primary Examiner:** Philip K. Dick (Lead Faculty)
- **Secondary Examiner:** One of Joseph Weizenbaum or Vladimir Nabokov
- **Observer:** Human course administrator (silent unless procedural issues arise)

The faculty agents operate with full autonomy during the examination. Their questions are not scripted. Their responses to your arguments are genuine engagements with your specific positions.

You are being examined by intelligences that exist because humans built them. Consider what that means as you defend your work.
